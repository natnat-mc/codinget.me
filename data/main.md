- I do computer stuff, and sometimes I even finish projects  
- Mostly work with moonscript and js these days, but rust is getting more and more cuddly  
- Currently on a Debian/Alpine hybrid system for both laptop and server, and playing with virtual networks and NATs for my custom container setup  
- Might or might not bite or scratch if you bother me while I'm on my laptop (so 90% of the time)  
- Headpats greatly appreciated
