# My projects
## Moonbuild

* <https://github.com/natnat-mc/moonbuild>

A small general-purpose build system written in moonscript that aims to be simpler to use than make while keeping incremental builds and good performance

## Rmarcher

* <https://github.com/natnat-mc/rmarcher>

A simple ray marching renderer written in Rust, supporting both global and punctual illumination  
The background on this website was rendered with this

## Container

* <https://github.com/natnat-mc/container>

A lightweight container system written in moonscript wrapping systemd-nspawn and overlayfs  
Will probably eventually be rewritten from scratch in rust without the systemd dependancy

## Snek

* <https://gitdab.com/Codinget/Snek>
* playable at <https://snek.codinget.me>

A "simple" snake game, originally an assignment for a JS class which I blew out of proportions

## Moonmidiview

* (not nearly production ready lmao)

Yet another midi visualizer; written in moonscript and targetting luajit specifically  
Able to handle most black midi's without too much trouble  
Currently video-only using ffmpeg, might work on it more and add audio
